We are using the OpenGL library to implement the project. OpenGL has a lot of inbuilt functions which makes the drawing of any geometric objects quite easy. This proposed system consists of a virtual tour of the college Environment. It provides the visitors such as Staff, Students, and Parents a virtual tour of the college. Many people wish to discover the college environments and facilities, Due to their busy schedules and work they may not be able to visit the college campus. This provides the guests with a virtual environment of a particular department, the whole college, or the specific sections desired by the visitor. Virtual campus can reproduce the real campus scene, which can make the people who have no chance to visit the site have the immersive experience. It can also build a 3D virtual university on this basis and then provide corresponding online education, with high application values.
